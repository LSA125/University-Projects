# How to run the application

1. download zip
2. extract file
3. open file with terminal or powershell
4. run ```ng build```
5. run ```ng serve```

Note: I have removed the storage server api key. This application will work offline 
however it will not remember data from the previous session. If you would like to use web storage,
insert an api key inside ```../src/app/report.service.ts```
